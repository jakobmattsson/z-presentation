// Start by reading the background in the README if you haven't yet.

// Solution #5

// Now we're talking! The 
// The functions "post", "concatUrl", "getAfter" and "assertEquals"
// not only returns promises now, but also accepts them as arguments.
// If you want implementation details, read this:
// https://github.com/jakobmattsson/z-presentation/issues/1

// The consequence of this is that no manual resolution of the promises
// is needed. We just recieve them and pass them around. No callback,
// no "then". There's not even a single function defined in this file now.

// It looks like it's written in another language, where everything is
// synchronous. But it's not. It's executing in parallel. And not just that.
// It executes *optimally*, because we ourselves have not defined the order
// in which the actions are to take place. Each promise will be resolved
// exactly when all it's dependencies are available and not a second later.

// This code is vastly more readable than all other examples and it executes
// faster without any manual effort. This is how promises should be used!
